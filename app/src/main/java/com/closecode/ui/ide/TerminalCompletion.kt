 * Path completion for the terminal.
 *
 * The shell cannot help here: it is fed through a pipe, so it has no readline, and Tab would be
 * passed straight through to the program the reader ran rather than completing anything. So the
 * completion is done by the app, against the project's own file tree — which means it knows the
 * project rather than having to guess by listing the filesystem, and it can offer a file the shell
 * would not have listed because it is hidden or ignored.
 *
 * The shell's working directory is invisible from out here, so the app follows `cd` itself. That is
 * a deliberate limitation: a program that changes directory without telling us desyncs completion,
 * and there is no way to ask the shell where it is without running a command in it.
