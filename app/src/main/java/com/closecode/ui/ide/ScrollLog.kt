/**
 * Every programmatic editor-scroll decision, with its reason and origin, in one place.
 *
 * Finger drags and flings move the scroll states directly and never come through here — only
 * code that moves the view on the reader's behalf records. An entry without a matching program
 * call, seen in the observer as `external`, is a scroll nobody asked for (the text field's own
 * bring-into-view is the usual suspect), and its timestamp says which finished job it followed.
 *
 * Always cheap: a bounded ring in memory plus one logcat line per entry. Mirroring into the
 * app's own Logcat panel is opt-in per session ([mirror]), so ordinary scrolling never spams
 * the panel the reader uses for builds.
